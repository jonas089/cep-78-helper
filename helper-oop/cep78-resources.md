# Cep-78 NFT Standard
The Cep-78 NFT Standard is a Casper smart contract that can be used to install instantiations of NFT collections on the blockchain.

## Introduction to _Modalities_


## Installing an NFT collection using the casper-client command line tool


## Installing an NFT collection using the cep-78-helper python tool
When installing Cep-78 using the casper-client command line tool, we have to supply plenty of modalities. To make this easier and help developer create re-usable templates for installing such instantiations of the contract, there exists a python-bash tool that can be a useful resource when installing NFT collections. It also includes some querying and call functionality, but the major advantage over the casper-client is for developers who want to quickly install a contract from a preconfigured bash script, without having to create such a bash script from scratch. Arguments such as the path to the secret_key file can be supplied via python _argparse_.
